# COMP55GroupProject
Overview:
The project will add a feature to the fight screen of the application Go Click Go!.
Currently, the game displays the statistics like monster health and the hit messages in the Eclipse console. The player is only able to play this game correctly if they have all the code present which is bad. 
This feature will implement faster updates to the fight screen, display monster voice lines, and hit messeges.

Pseudocode:
Create border to display the monster voiceline
Create border to display the user voiceline
grab the monster and user health
When the monster is clicked:
  display the monster hp from the monster voiceline border
